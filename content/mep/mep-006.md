# Federated instrumentDefinitions

## Abstract

This MEP introduces the concept of federated instrumentDefinitions.

## Current status

InstrumentDefinitions in Open-Transactions are currently notary-
specific and not portable between notaries.

It is also not possible to update instrumentDefinitions.

## Drawbacks

Without federated instrumenDefinitions it's not possible to create
voting pool contacts, nor is it possible to create balances that are
portable between notaries.

## Enhancement

Add additional elements and attributes to instrumentDefinitions to
describe the information needed for federation.

Create a new attribute type "Descriptor" which contains an encoded
color coin descriptor.

## Impact

Every place in the code which handles instrumentDefinitionIDs will need
to learn to handle Descriptors as well as Identifiers.

Clients and notaries that need to validate federated
instrumentDefinitions will require access to a blockchain, directly or
via an appropriate service which they can query.
